## Capstone Project: Dog Pass

My app allows dog owners to store important data about their beloved four-legged friends, such as date and place of birth, gender, breed, but also the transponder ID, vaccinations and insurance. This way, you always have this information with you when you go for a walk or on a longer trip and e.g. can show it to the vet in case of an emergency.
