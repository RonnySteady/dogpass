My name is Ronald, 45 years and living near Frankfurt/Germany and somewhere between digital native and digital immigrant. After 20 years of various positions in Sales and Account Management now I am on my way to become a web developer.

## Capstone Project

My app allows dog owners to store important data about their beloved four-legged friends, such as date and place of birth, gender, breed, but also the transponder ID, vaccinations and insurance. This way, you always have this information with you when you go for a walk or on a longer trip and e.g. can show it to the vet in case of an emergency.
